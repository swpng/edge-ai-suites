The **Education AI Suite** is a preview collection of education-focused AI applications, libraries, and benchmarking tools to help developers build intelligent classroom solutions faster. It provides audio and video pipelines accelerated with the OpenVINO™ toolkit, enabling high-performance deployment on **Intel® CPUs, integrated GPUs, and NPUs**.

This suite organizes workflows tailored for the education sector, with initial support for the **Smart Classroom** application—an extensible framework for processing, analyzing, and summarizing classroom sessions using advanced multimodal AI.

The main features are as follows:

**Audio Intelligence**
-	Audio transcription with ASR models (e.g., Whisper, Paraformer)
-	Summarization using powerful LLMs (e.g., Qwen, LLaMA)
-	Plug-and-play architecture for integrating new ASR and LLM models
-	API-first design ready for frontend integration
- Extensible roadmap for real-time streaming, diarization, translation, and video analysis
  
**Video Intelligence**
- Front Camera Pipeline: Student **pose detection**: sitting, standing, hand raise, leaning
- Rear Camera Pipeline: **Re-Identification (ReID)** to track students consistently across camera views
- Board Camera Pipeline: **Board content classification**
